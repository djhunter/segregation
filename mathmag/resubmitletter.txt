Dear Dr. Rosenhouse,

I am submitting a revision of manuscript number MATHMAG-D-19-00219, Segregation Surfaces, for your consideration. Please thank the anonymous referee for the helpful suggestions. I believe we have made all of the requested revisions. Below is a summary of how specific concerns of the referee have been addressed in the new version of the paper. Referee comments are preceded by an asterisk (*).

* "'Segregation usually takes place on a map' is not literally correct."
The second paragraph of the introduction has been rephrased.

* "I believe the definition of the index is not really dependent on the spatial partition of the region."
The phrase "depends on" has been replaced by "requires".

* "I expected |A| and |B| be the absolute values of A and B."
The notation and explanation preceding the definition of D has been clarified.

* "Geographers and to some extent sociologists have been doing that all the time...Many maps created by geographers belong
to the type called choropleth map..."
A new figure (Figure 3) shows a choropleth map along with contours of the surface that approximates it. A new paragraph explaining the connection between choropleth maps and f-hat begins on the bottom of page 4, and the final paragraph of this section has been revised to explain the connection between Figure 3 and Figure 4.

* "1/n is not a necessary condition for D = 0."
This sentence has been rephrased.

* "Fig 1: the meaning of the shading needs to be provided in the figure or the caption."
The meaning of the shading is explained in the text directly below the figure.

* "A good addition to the summaries of literature, besides 10 and 3, is a recent piece by Yao et al....
The debates questioning if segregation really has five dimensions should include not just 10, but
also Johnston et al. ... and Brown and Chung 2006."
These references now appear in the bibliography and are cited in the text.

* "[T]he segregation gradient ... is essentially the same as spatial autocorrelation (SA), measuring the similarity (or the difference) of neighboring values. ... Particularly, Geary Ratio, a popular SA measure.... I believe the author should at least acknowledge the similarity (if not identical) to these existing concepts."
The concepts are conceptually similar, but not identical. Geary's C is now included in Table 1, and the associated discussion of the correlations among various indexes has been updated. It turns out the C is most strongly correlated with S, not G_C or G_R.

* "[T}he graphical representation in Figure 4 ... is not easy to interpret ... intuitively. More explanations are needed."
The caption of this figure (now Figure 5) has been expanded to complement the explanation in the text.

* "[T]he 50-50 contour as the boundary has been proposed more than five decades ago in spatial interaction modeling and market delineation (Huff model)."
An additional idea for an undergraduate research project now appears at the end of the bulleted list. This item suggests comparing a construction similar to f-hat to the surface of the Huff model (which has quite a different construction).

* "[T]he two groups to be compared are usually not of the same sizes, such as white vs. black in the U.S. Thus, the 50-50 contour may be undetermined."
The discussion following equation (5) has been expanded to emphasize this point.

* "The results from Eq. 6, on the other hand, seem counterintuitive."
The introduction to Equation (6) has been expanded to provide a transition between the two functions, and to explain the motivation (a nonexistent 50% contour).

Kind Regards,
