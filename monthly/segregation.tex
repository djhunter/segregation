\title{Beyond Quantification: Visualizing Patterns of Segregation}

\begin{abstract}
  TODO: In particular, we introduce the \textit{segregation gradient}, which provides an alternative numerical measure of the severity of segregation, as well as a geometric indicator of barriers to integration.
\end{abstract}

\noindent Over the past half century, social scientists have developed an array of techniques for measuring the nature and extent of segregation. \cite{example1} Numerical indices have been the principal tool for quantifying the isolation and clustering of groups defined by race, income, education, and other factors. These measurements provide objective ways to track segregation trends over time, to classify different forms of geographic inequality, and to discern differences between metropolitan areas.

However, since segregation is fundamentally a property of the dispersion of groups in two-dimensional space, numerical summary statistics alone are limited when it comes to discerning geometric patterns in the data. In this note, we extend the machinery behind some commonly-used segregation indices to glean deeper insight through analytic constructions and computer visualizations. This extension will only require tools that are easily accessible to undergraduate mathematics and data science students.  [TODO: Say something here about the organization of the paper.]
